About
=====

A collection of short movies highlighting the position-position-velocity (PPV)
structure of molecular gas. These movies are generated in IDL using the output
results from SCOUSE (https://github.com/jdhenshaw/SCOUSE).

accepted, arXiv:1601.03732

A PPV movie highlighting the large-scale kinematic structure of the CMZ. Each
pixel denotes the location and centroid velocity of a Gaussian component
identified in HNCO emission and extracted using Scouse. The size
(from small to large) and colour (from light to dark) of each data point is
proportional to the peak intensity of the corresponding spectral component. At
the base of the plot, in logarithmic colour-scale, is the Herschel-derived
molecular hydrogen column density map (Battersby et al., in prep.). Column
densities range from 10^22–10^24 cm^−2. Overlaid are contours highlighting the
distribution of HNCO integrated emission. Contour levels are, 5, 25, 45, 65, and
85 per cent of peak (integrated) emission.
